A little excercise in Arduino POV-fu
by Christiane Ruetten, cr ät 23bit dot net

This code is mostly undocumented, but it should
be ready to use in the Arduino environment.

Hook up your ADXL's analog X and Y pins to Arduino
pins A0 and A1, and use 10 LEDs with load resistors
on pins D2 to D11.

I used an ADXL330 breakout which has the sensor
mounted at an 45° angle. If your sensor is mounted
in an ordinary fashion, remove the coordinate base
rotation by replacing

void read_sensor() {
  float xr, yr;
  sensorPrevX = sensorX;
  sensorPrevY = sensorY;
  xr = analogRead( A0 ) - sensorX0;
  yr = analogRead( A1 ) - sensorY0;
  sensorX = 0.707107 * (xr - yr);
  sensorY = 0.707107 * (xr + yr);
}

with

void read_sensor() {
  sensorPrevX = sensorX;
  sensorPrevY = sensorY;
  sensorX = analogRead( A0 ) - sensorX0;
  sensorY = analogRead( A1 ) - sensorY0;
}

Just make sure you get the axis right. The code
assumes that, looking towards the leds, swinging
the LEDs to the right produces a positive sensor
signal. If unsure, try swapping A0 and A1. If your
animation appears mirrored, swap the invocations
of right_frame_sync() and left_frame_sync().

Have fun! :)
